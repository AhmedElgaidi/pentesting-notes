# How to do Recon | API Enumeration:

## Quick recap: (What is APIs?)
- APIs are a way of communication between a server and it's client (website, mobile, desktop, another server, etc...).
- APIs are predictable and follow a certain structure/ pattern.
- APIs always return JSON.
- There are different types as RESTful and GraphQL APIs.

## Why do we need to do API enumeration?
- To increase the surfacearea of the attack.
- To find endpoints that would't normally be available.
- To find enpoints that requires specific set of actions (Think about complex buisness logic).

## How to do API enumeration?
**Note:** we do both (autmated and manual) approaches.
##### 1) Automated approach:
- We use tools that allows us to bruteforce a ton of URLs and sort them.
- We want a list of words (wordlist) to try to bruteforce.
- Look for tools that also brute force parameters (we are not only bruteforcing the endpoints!!!).
- e.g. 
    - Generic Bruteforcing tool: Burp intruder or ffuf
    - parameter bruteforcing tool: arjun

##### 2) Manual approach:
- For manual testing, we need to look and see what the website makes public.
- Read the provided public documentation of any kind to get more info (At least the whole idea of api working!) such as: for developers or any specific guides that may help!!

#### What is the goal from using these tool?
- We want our destination to really be URLs, we can load up in burpsuite, and go to the next level (finding bugs).
- Our goal is a list of valid URLs.
- It might be so beneficial to see what each valid endpoint returns, so we can check for sensitive data exposure.

##### What is after preparing our list of valid endpoints?
- Level up to the next phase (finding bugs).
- Keep an eye out for: 
    - Any endpoint returning a lot of info.
    - IDS.
    - Any signs of internal APIs.
    - Reflected input.

##### Easy API enumeration:
- Read the docs.
- Many publish their API in docs as in postman you made before or use service like swagger.
