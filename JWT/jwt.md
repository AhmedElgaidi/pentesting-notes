# JWT:
1. JWT are commonly used in: 
    - Authentication.
    - Session Mangement.
    - Access control mechanisms.
2. Unlike with classic session tokens, all of the data that a server needs is stored client-side within the JWT itself. This makes JWTs a popular choice for highly distributed websites where users need to interact seamlessly with multiple back-end servers.
